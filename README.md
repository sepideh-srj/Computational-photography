Computational Photography
Overview
This repository contains programming assignments and resources for the Computational Photography course at SFU. It focuses on advanced image manipulation techniques and computational photography methods implemented in MATLAB.

Projects
Iterative Edge-Aware Filtering - Implements techniques for enhancing image edges without amplifying noise.
Poisson Blending - Demonstrates seamless blending of images using Poisson image editing techniques.
Texture Synthesis - Explores methods for generating large, seamless textures from a small sample.
Getting Started
To use these projects, clone the repository and open the files in MATLAB. Each folder contains specific instructions and MATLAB scripts for running the projects.
