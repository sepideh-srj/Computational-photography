# Computational Photography

## Overview
This repository contains programming assignments and resources for the Computational Photography course at SFU. It focuses on advanced image manipulation techniques and computational photography methods implemented in MATLAB.

## Projects
1. **Iterative Edge-Aware Filtering** - Implements techniques for enhancing image edges without amplifying noise.
2. **Poisson Blending** - Demonstrates seamless blending of images using Poisson image editing techniques.
3. **Texture Synthesis** - Explores methods for generating large, seamless textures from a small sample.

## Getting Started
To use these projects, clone the repository and open the files in MATLAB. Each folder contains specific instructions and MATLAB scripts for running the projects.
